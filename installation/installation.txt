A) Install OpenGL
You need not do anything for this step; OpenGL v1.1 software runtime is already included as part of the operating system for Windows 7, WinXP, Windows 2000, Windows 98, Windows 95 (OSR2) and Windows NT.
 
B) Install GLUT:
The first step is to download GLUT. The necessary files are included in glut-3.7.6-bin.zip, or at the following URL:
 
http://www.xmission.com/~nate/glut/glut-3.7.6-bin.zip
 
C) Copy the libraries and header files into their proper locations.
 
If you are running a 64-bit operating system (XP 64, Vista 64, or Windows 7 64):
 
1. Copy glut32.dll into "c:\Windows\SysWOW64"
2. Copy glut.h into "c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\Include\gl\"
3. Copy glut32.lib into "c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\Lib\"
 
If you are running a 32-bit operating system:
 
1. Copy glut32.dll into c:\Windows\System
2. Copy glut.h into "c:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\Include\gl\"
3. Copy glut32.lib into "c:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\Lib"
 
D) Run the game by running \Katamari\Katamari.exe
